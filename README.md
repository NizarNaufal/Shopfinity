## üì¶ Module Overview

Each module is designed to be loosely coupled and independently testable. The project applies clean architecture principles with the following layers:

- **App Layer** ‚Äì Handles navigation and root Compose scaffolding.
- **Core Layer** ‚Äì Contains reusable and shared code like networking, data handling, and extensions.
- **Feature Layer** ‚Äì Self-contained features for modular UI and logic.
- **Build Logic** ‚Äì Convention plugins that reduce duplication and keep Gradle setup clean.
